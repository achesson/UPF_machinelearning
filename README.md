machine learning projects

Projects in this directory were created as part of coursework completed in University Pompeu Fabra's Machine Learning Course
conducted by the Masters in Intelligent and Interactive Systems (MIIS).

The projects concern understanding the theory behind specific machine learning algorithms by highlighting specific hyperparameter
manipulation to show the advantages/disadvantages and characteristics of different learning approaches. 

All datasets used in the notebooks are publicly available from LIBSVM (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/)
